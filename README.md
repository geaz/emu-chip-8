# A CHIP-8 emulator written in C++ (WIP)

This emulator should run cross platform. Use CMAKE to compile it and
run it with the roms in the *roms* folder.  
This project was done to learn how to write a simple emulator, get a bettter understanding of
CPUs and to learn a bit of C++.

Usage example (Windows):  
```
emu-chip-8.exe roms/BRIX
```
